# Scala for the Impatient - Solutions
My own solutions to the exercises contained in [Scala for the Impatient](http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html) by [Cay Horstmann](http://www.horstmann.com/).

## Important Notes
* I am in no way affiliated with Addison-Wesley or Cay Horstmann, hence you should *NOT* consider these as the "official" solutions;
* I decided to share these solutions here in order to eventually help those who couldn't get the hang of an exercise;
* These solutions reflect my knowledge and my thoughts regarding the Scala programming language; as such, they might be 
incomplete or convoluted. Should you find a better, more elegant solution, don't hesitate to give me your feedback and/or start a new pull request;
* I struggled to maintain the solutions as close as possible to the content of the relevant chapter; as such, don't expect to find
 advanced topics in the first solutions!
* You may notice that this repository doesn't contain the solutions to some of the exercises; I only committed those which could be turned into a Scala class. 
For instance, some exercises require you to directly interact with the Scala REPL.
