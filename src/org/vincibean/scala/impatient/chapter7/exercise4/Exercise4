Q: Why do you think the Scala language designers provided the package object syntax instead of simply letting you add
functions and variables to a package?
A: As written by Cay Horstmann: "A package can contain classes, objects, and traits, but not the definitions of functions
or variables. Thatâ€™s an unfortunate limitation of the Java virtual machine."
