Q: What is the meaning of private[com] def giveRaise(rate: Double)? Is it useful?
A: In Java, it's possible to make a class member belong to the package which contains that class, i.e. every object belonging
to the given package (and only those objects!) have access to that class member.
In Scala, you can achieve the same effect with a qualifiers like private[package_name]; moreover, you are given even more
flexibility: you can declare a qualifier like private[package_containing_the_package],
private[package_containing_the_package_containing_the_package], and so on.
A qualifier like the one above (private[com]) restricts the access to all those classes that are somehow contained
in package "com". Since this is the root package for most of the packages, a qualifier like this is accessible by almost
every class, making this declaration hardly a good idea.
