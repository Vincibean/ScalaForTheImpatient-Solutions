Q: What is the effect of

   import java._
   import javax._

   Is this a good idea?

A: It will bring all packages and classes under the java and javax packages in scope. Considering the high amount of
packages and classes under these, such generic imports are hardly a good idea. Moreover, given such a high number of
packages and classe, this also brings a high chance of name clashes.
