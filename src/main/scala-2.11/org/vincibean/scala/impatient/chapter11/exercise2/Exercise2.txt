Q:  The BigInt class has a pow method, not an operator. Why didn't the Scala library
    designers choose ** (as in Fortran) or ^ (as in Pascal) for a power operator?

A:  In Scala, operator precedence is determined by the 1st character of the operator name; hence, for **, the
    multiplication operator, *, would take precedence, which of course would be mathematically incorrect; moreover,
    operators starting with a letter take precedence over operators starting with a symbol like *.
    As for ^, BigInt already has such an operator: it's the Bitwise exclusive-or of BigInts.
