/**
  * There are dozens of Scala trait tutorials with silly examples of barking dogs
  * or philosophizing frogs. Reading through contrived hierarchies can be
  * tedious and not very helpful, but designing your own is very illuminating.
  * Make your own silly trait hierarchy example that demonstrates layered
  * traits, concrete and abstract methods, and concrete and abstract fields.
