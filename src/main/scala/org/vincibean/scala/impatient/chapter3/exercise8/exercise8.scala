/**
  * Suppose you are given an array buffer of integers and want to remove all but
  * the first negative number. Here is a sequential solution that sets a flag
  * when the first negative number is called, then removes all elements beyond.
  *
  *   var first = true
  *   var n = a.length
  *   var i=0
  *   while (i < n){
  *     if (a(i) >= 0) i += 1
  *     else {
  *       if (first) { first = false; i += 1 }
  *       else { a.remove(i); n -= 1 }
  *     }
  *   }
  *
  * This is a complex and inefficient solution. Rewrite it in Scala by collecting
  * positions of the negative elements, dropping the first element, reversing the
  * sequence, and calling a.remove(i) for each index.
