/**
  * In Section 13.10, "Zipping", on page 187, the expression (prices zip quantities)
  * map { p => p._1 * p._2 } is a bit inelegant. We canâ€™t do (prices zip quantities) map
  * { _ * _ } because _ * _ is a function with two arguments, and we need a
  * function with one argument that is a tuple. The tupled method of the Function
  * object changes a function with two arguments to one that takes a tuple. Apply
  * tupled to the multiplication function so you can map it over the list of pairs.
