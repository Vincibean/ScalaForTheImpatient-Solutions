Q: The file scala/collection/immutable/Stack.scala contains the definition
   class Stack[A] protected (protected val elems: List[A])
   Explain the meanings of the protected keywords. (Hint: Review the discussion
   of private constructors in Chapter 5.)

A: A protected member is only accessible from the same class and from the subclasses of the class in which
the member is defined. A protected constructor can only be accessed by an auxiliary constructor from the
same or from descendant class.
