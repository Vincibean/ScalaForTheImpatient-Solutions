"Sagan"
Make me wonder
Make me understand
Spark the light of doubt and a newborn mind
Bring the vast unthinkable down to Earth
Always wary of a captive thought
Beware the very first unkind word
See who you are, where from, what of
Entering the unknown
Sending all the poets to the stars
Daring to see beyond the man-made
Woe to you who evade the horizon
Listening to Sagan
Dreaming Carl Sagan
Unseen streams
With understanding no poet is trapped
Woe to all who stop at the horizon
What kind of world would we call home
Our own
Oasis of love, humility and hope
Eradicating all that's not for life
What kind of aim would we call high
What kind of life would bath in the brightest white
A limitless world will arise
Son of man, dare to let go of the cowardice
